Objective:

Produce the score for one single-lane game of American ten-pin bowling
↳ Not checking if rolls are valid or invalid
↳ Not checking for the correct number of rolls and frames
↳ Not scoring intermediate frames (?)


Game Rules:

Ten-pin bowling:
↳ Game consists of 10 “frames”
↳ Each frame provides players two opportunities to knock down all ten pins
↳ The score for a frame is the total number of pins knocked down, and any bonuses
↳ A “spare” is when all 10 pins are knocked down in those two attempts, thus completing the frame
	↳ Bonus: the first roll of the next frame; that score will therefore count twice!
↳ A “strike” is when all 10 pins are knocked down in the very first roll of a frame, essentially completing the frame
	↳ Bonus: the score of the next two rolls!
↳ This way, the max score for a frame is 30, including bonuses
	↳ Thus for a game of 10 frames, it’s 300
↳ Additionally, if a player scores a strike or a spare in the final (10th) frame, they do get to roll the extra balls but no more    than three rolls are allowed in the final frame, this way a game can have a maximum of 12 strikes

Approach:

1.	The core-nature:
	A roll can be valid or invalid, but since that’s out of scope, let’s assume all rolls are valid
	A valid roll may make contact with the pins, or it may go to the gutter
	If it does strike the pins, some or all may fall over:
↳ Precisely calculating which pins fall will require a physics engine, this brings us to an important fork in our design approach!
	The game can be designed to be luck-based or skill-based:
↳ A skill-based game will require physics calculation determining the roll-path of the ball and the pin-impact
↳ A luck-based game will simply proceed by randomly picking outcomes, we start with this approach!

2.	A luck-based approach:
	Central to this approach would be a random Boolean: TRUE(1) for a favorable outcome, FALSE(0) otherwise
	A roll strikes the pins (Boolean: TRUE (1)) or misses and goes to the gutter (Boolean: FALSE(0))
	Since this is luck-based and not skill/physics-based, let’s assume that if the pins are struck by our ball, they collide either head-on or in the pockets:
↳ Statistically, the pockets are more favorable for a strike, so let’s assume that hitting the pocket gets us a strike
↳ Conversely, hitting head-on is more unpredictable, so let’s assume a head-on hit can lead to either a strike where all the pins fall or we end up with a split where some are still left standing
↳ If it’s a split, the remaining roll will either knock down the remaining pins or we’re left with an open frame!
